# HealthEndpointMonitoring
One of my Node-Red subflows for Google Summer of Code. (Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern implemented...)

DESCRIPTION: This subflow continuosly checks the connection health between client and the server by sending requests and gathers status codes, SSL certificate and DNS status. Also validates the returned URL, calculates the aproximate data of network and DNS latency. In general it monitors the status of the network all together. Domain name, DNS time health points, response time health points are the variables that can be changed by the user.
